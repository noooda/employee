# OOP Task: Employee Management
Design a class structure for managing employees using object-oriented principles in Java.

## Requirements

### 1. Class Definitions
Define the following classes with appropriate attributes and methods:
- `Employee`
- `Manager`
- `Engineer`

### 2. Inheritance
- `Manager` and `Engineer` should inherit from `Employee`.

### 3. Interfaces
- Define and implement at least one interface to represent shared behaviors across classes (e.g. `Workable`, `Reportable`).

### 4. Method Overriding
- Override relevant methods in `Manager` and `Engineer` to define class-specific behaviors (e.g. how each role performs work or generates reports).

### 5. Encapsulation
- Use private fields and provide public getters and setters as needed.

### 6. Additional Notes
- Do not include implementation details or concrete code.
- Focus on class design and behavioral relationships.

## Example Concepts
- A `Manager` may have additional responsibilities such as evaluating team performance.
- An `Engineer` might focus on implementing features or fixing bugs.
